Some python courses for my son...

## Introduction on Python

Python is a powerful programming language that's fairly easy to learn. To run python code, several options:

- Create a file with a `.py` extension, write your code inside and run it with e.g. `python my_program.py`
- Run code interactively line by line using the python shell: just run `python` and write your instructions
- Write a Jupyter Notebook, a file that lets you mix some instructional text (using Markdown syntax) together with blocks of python code. You can then run each block independently from your editor or online Jupyter Notebook app.

These lessons will use the last method (Jupyter Notebooks), but the same code would work using any of these methods.

## How to use / run

### Option 1: View directly on Github

Github will show the last run results from a local run.

### Option 2: check out and run locally

VSCode has built-in support to run Jupyter Notebook files, including inspectiing variables, running ste by step etc...

### Option 3: use an online Jupyter Notebook service

You can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) to open notebooks directly from this Github repo. Just use the Open menu and use this repo's URL (<https://github.com/Yann-J/python-learning>) to load any file from it.

Alternatively, you can use the following direct links to each lesson:

- [Lesson 1 - Variables and Types](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Yann-J/python-learning/blob/main/Lesson%201%20-%20Variables%20and%20Types.ipynb)
- [Lesson 2 - Flow Control](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Yann-J/python-learning/blob/main/Lesson%202%20-%20Flow%20Control.ipynb)
- [Lesson 3 - Functions](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Yann-J/python-learning/blob/main/Lesson%203%20-%20Functions.ipynb)
- [Lesson 4 - Regular Expressions](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Yann-J/python-learning/blob/main/Lesson%204%20-%20Regular%20Expressions.ipynb)
- [Lesson 5 - Dates](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Yann-J/python-learning/blob/main/Lesson%205%20-%20Dates.ipynb)
